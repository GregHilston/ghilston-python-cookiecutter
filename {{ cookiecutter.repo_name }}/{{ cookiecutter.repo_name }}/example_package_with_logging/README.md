An example Python package using our own `example_utils_package`.

## Tests

To run this package's test, we first must install the `example_utils_package`. With a virtual environment active, simply navigate to the `example_utisl_package` directory and run `$ python3 -m pip install -e . `. This will install the package in "editable" mode, meaning that changes made to the source code will automatically be reflected, and not require a reinstallation.

Then run `$ pytest` in this directory.
